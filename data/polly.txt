You remain in motion
Bottom of the ocean
Not yet sick of sycophants
Tellin' you their true lies
Like, "No moon is higher"
Hollow as a hallway
Your fist fits right through me
If I split my body into two men
Would you then love me better?
Octopus myself so you weather this
Sea, sea, sea Polly
Sea, sea, sea Polly
See, see, see, see me
You love dancin' with me
Or you just love dancin'
Polly, Polly, Polly
I don't wanna live here
Sometimes don't wanna live at all
I want to be cotton candy
In the mouth of many a lover
Saccharine and slick technicolor
I'll dissolve
I know that won't solve this (I want to dissolve)
Evolve into rain and spit
You make me go unstitched
Are you dancin' with me?
Or just merely dancin'?
Polly, Polly, Polly
One, two, three, four, five, six
Am I just your Friday dick
Cornucopia of just-in-cases
You'll never have to chase this
Woah, Polly, Polly
Obviously don't think much of me
Polly, Polly, Polly, Polly, Polly ooh
