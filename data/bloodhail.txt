I feel the top of the roof come off
Kill everybody there
And I'm watching all the stars burn out
Trying to pretend that I care
But I didn't, no one ever does
And I would, no one ever will
Can't you see it's all flown out of my hands?
And our clothes are all too often ripped
And our teeth are all too often gnashed
And it lasts as long as it possibly can
But I just don't, but I just don't accept this
I just don't accept this at all
And I just don't, and I just don't accept this
I just don't accept this at all
And I just don't, and I just don't accept this
I just don't accept this at all
And I just don't, and I just don't accept this
I just don't accept this at all
Faces sweaty, arms and legs
What a glorious set of stairs we make
Faces sweaty, arms and legs
What a glorious set of stairs we make
Faces sweaty, arms and legs
What a glorious set of stairs we make
Faces sweaty, arms and legs
We kill everyone with
Arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads
Arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads
Arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads
Arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads
Thank god that's over
Thank god that's over
Thank god that's over
Thank god that's over
Thank god that's over
Thank god that's over
Thank god that's over
Thank god that's over
Thank god that's over
Thank god that's over
Thank god that's over
Thank god that's over
But I didn't, no one ever does
And I would, no one ever will
Can't you see it's all flown out of my hands?
And our clothes are all too often ripped
And our teeth are all too often gnashed
And it lasts as long as it possibly can
