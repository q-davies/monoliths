You know, had to know what it felt like
Felt like the world, weren't beneath my feet
Said a distant voice, on the end of the other line
And I think there's a part of me
Limbering sober limbs on a beach
She fell asleep in the sunshine
Just a tiny little part of me
Baked bean of mythology, that humbles pie
Hello
Is there anyone in there?
Oh the adverts, the TV
The sofa's best friends for another week
(All of this, but I still feel so empty inside)
And outside was the world shrinking?
Pavement still sinking
Beneath another creep, another night
Sometimes I could feel so weak
Ain't had a drink for weeks
He needs peanuts, needs a pint
I hope I don't become these at the bar
They speak of tales so near, yet so far
And some had even lost their minds
And Tony said, "That he went, and he went, and he went
And he went, and he went, and he went
And I went
And he thinks it's a lie
And Errol dreamt that he'd watched "Babylon"
Again and again and again and again and again
On London live, just last night
Another seahorse grows inside
24, in the cells, bitten styrofoam cups to hell
Of teas a plenty
And all alone, his rib cage xylophone
And for he who spied
The uniform that I believe those racist police
Who still sit there to this day
And sat there way back in '89
And after all, the type O negative painted the walls
All the irreparable damage to your skull
They said your brain might never be the same
But at least you're still one of a kind
And if all that scum rose to the top
Then why were we left behind? (Since day one)
Another seahorse floats on by
Another seahorse grows inside
Another seahorse grows inside
Another seahorse grows inside
Another seahorse grows inside
